# Context files

Context files are Markdown instruction files that `omp` discovers automatically before a session starts and injects into the agent's project context. Use them for repository conventions, architecture notes, test and review expectations, and instructions that should travel with a user account or a project.

You never have to ask the agent to go read `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md`, or similar files — the relevant ones are already discovered, loaded, and placed in context when the session begins.

## How context files relate to other concepts

Four similarly named things behave differently. Keep them straight:

- **Context files** are read as plain Markdown and shown to the agent in generated project instructions (inside `<repo-rules>` with the default prompt template). They are session-opening instructions and background for repository work.
- **Sticky rules** come from a top-level native `RULES.md`. They are converted into an always-apply rule that is re-attached near the current turn, so they keep their hold even after the visible conversation grows. See "Sticky rules vs normal context" below.
- **Discovery providers** are the config-source adapters (`native`, `claude`, `codex`, `gemini`, `opencode`, `github`, `agents`, `agents-md`) that know where each tool keeps its files. The same provider that contributes context files may also contribute MCP servers, slash commands, skills, hooks, tools, prompts, and settings.
- **Model providers** are inference backends such as `anthropic`, `openai`, `google`, `groq`, `ollama`, and `openrouter`. They have nothing to do with context files except that both kinds of id share the one `disabledProviders` list — see "Disabling discovery providers" below and [Providers](./providers.md).

Authoring **skills** and **rule** files (as opposed to the sticky `RULES.md`) is covered in [Skills](./skills.md). Customizing the system prompt with `SYSTEM.md` is covered in [System prompt customization](./system-prompt-customization.md).

## Native `.aura` files

The native provider is the recommended format for new projects. It reads from your user agent directory and from `.aura/` directories inside a project, and it has the highest discovery priority, so its files win over every other convention at the same scope.

| File                                          | Scope   | Behavior                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| --------------------------------------------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `~/.aura/agent/AGENTS.md`                      | User    | User-level context for every session unless the `native` provider is disabled.                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `<nearest-non-empty-ancestor>/.aura/AGENTS.md` | Project | Project context, but only when `AGENTS.md` exists in the **nearest non-empty `.aura/` directory** found while walking from cwd toward the repository root. Discovery does not continue to a farther `.aura/` directory when the nearest one lacks this file. |
| `~/.aura/agent/RULES.md`                       | User    | User-level sticky rule content. Loaded as an always-apply rule, not as a context file.                                                                                                                                                               |
| `<nearest-non-empty-ancestor>/.aura/RULES.md`  | Project | Project sticky content, but only when `RULES.md` exists in the same nearest non-empty `.aura/` directory selected by the walk.                                                                                                                        |

Two details matter:

- **The nearest non-empty `.aura/` directory owns native project discovery.** Discovery starts in the current working directory and climbs toward the repository root. Once it finds a non-empty `.aura/`, it stops; native `AGENTS.md` and `RULES.md` are each read from that directory only. A missing file does not make discovery continue upward.
- **Empty directories and files contribute nothing.** An empty `.aura/` directory is skipped during the walk. In the selected non-empty directory, an empty `AGENTS.md` or `RULES.md` contributes nothing.

`~/.aura/agent` is shorthand for the active native agent directory. `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` relocates it. A named profile (`aura --profile <name>`, or the `AURA_PROFILE` environment variable — `OMP_PROFILE` and `PI_PROFILE` are legacy aliases consulted in that order) uses `~/.aura/profiles/<name>/agent` by default; external-tool user bases such as `~/.claude` are not profile-scoped.

### Pre-rebrand `.omp` directories

`.aura` is the native config directory; `.omp` was its name before the rename. A pre-rebrand **project** directory is still discovered, ranked directly below the branded one so `.aura` wins every conflict. **Nothing is ever written into a `.omp` directory.**

- **It contributes the same surfaces as `.aura`, not just context files.** Alongside `AGENTS.md` / `RULES.md` / `SYSTEM.md`, the native provider loads a legacy `.omp/`'s `rules/`, `prompts/`, `agents/`, `skills/`, `commands/`, `extensions/`, `mcp.json` / `.mcp.json` servers, **`tools/*` custom tools, and `hooks/pre/*` + `hooks/post/*` — which auto-fire around tool calls with no approval prompt.** "Read-only" means nothing is written there; it does **not** mean the content is inert. That is deliberate — `.omp` is your own pre-rebrand config dir, carrying the same trust as `.aura` and as the `.claude` / `.codex` / `.gemini` bases whose hooks and tools are already loaded — but it is worth knowing before you leave a stale `.omp/` in a repository you did not write.
- **Settings documents are the one exception.** A legacy `config.yml` / `settings.json` is never loaded wholesale; see [Settings](./settings.md#where-settings-live) for the two narrow slices that are read.
- **For `AGENTS.md` / `RULES.md` / `SYSTEM.md` the probe is per *file*, branded first then legacy, at each ancestor.** Unrelated branded content (say a `.aura/rules/` directory) therefore never masks a legacy `.omp/AGENTS.md` — the incremental-adoption case the legacy base exists for. A legacy directory may *supply* the file but never *terminates* the walk: only a non-empty `.aura/` stops it, so a stale subpackage `.omp/` cannot suppress the repository's branded file.
- **User level: nothing.** `~/.omp/agent` is on no read path at all. Set `PI_CONFIG_DIR=.omp` if you need pre-rebrand user-level files back.

### Monorepo example

```text
repo/
  .aura/
    AGENTS.md
    RULES.md
  packages/api/
    .aura/
      AGENTS.md
```

Starting a session in `repo/packages/api`:

- The native context file is `repo/packages/api/.aura/AGENTS.md` (the nearest one). `repo/.aura/AGENTS.md` is **not** also included.
- Because `repo/packages/api/.aura/` is the nearest non-empty native directory, project sticky content can only come from `repo/packages/api/.aura/RULES.md`. If that file is absent, `repo/.aura/RULES.md` is **not** used.

Put broad, durable project background in `AGENTS.md`. Reserve `RULES.md` for short, hard requirements that must stay visible across long conversations.

## Other supported context conventions

`omp` also discovers the context and rule files of other agent tools so existing projects keep working without migration.

User file in the active native agent directory; project file is read only from the nearest non-empty `.aura/` directory walking toward the repo root.                                                                                                                                                                                 |

Project-level Codex context comes from a standalone `AGENTS.md` via the `agents-md` provider, not from `<cwd>/.codex/AGENTS.md`.                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| `github`    | `.github/copilot-instructions.md`           | User + project | Project file `<cwd>/.github/copilot-instructions.md` only (no ancestor walk-up), plus a user-global `~/.copilot/copilot-instructions.md` (relocate with `COPILOT_HOME`). `AGENTS.md` candidates from `COPILOT_CUSTOM_INSTRUCTIONS_DIRS` are also considered at user scope, where normal one-user-file deduplication applies.                                 |
| `agents`    | `.agent/AGENTS.md`, `.agents/AGENTS.md`     | User + project | User files from `~/.agent/` and `~/.agents/`; project files discovered while walking up from the current directory to the repository root.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `agents-md` | `AGENTS.md`                                 | Project        | Standalone (non-config-directory) `AGENTS.md` files, discovered by walking up from the current directory to the repository root (or home when no repo root is known). Files whose parent directory name starts with `.` are ignored — those belong to a config-directory provider instead.                                                                   |
| `github`    | `.github/instructions/**/*.instructions.md` | Project rules  | GitHub Copilot / VS Code instruction files become rules. `applyTo: '*'`, `applyTo: '**'`, or `applyTo: '**/*'` is injected as always-apply content; other `applyTo` globs are listed in the rulebook with a generated description when needed and are readable as `rule://<name>`. Missing `applyTo` also produces a rulebook entry and a discovery warning. |

Providers marked "(no ancestor walk-up)" only look in the current working directory's config directory. If you need ancestor walk-up behavior, prefer the native `.aura/AGENTS.md` format or a standalone `AGENTS.md` (the `agents-md` provider), or launch `omp` from the directory that holds the config directory.

## Load order and shadowing

When two providers describe the _same_ scope, the higher-priority provider wins. Provider priorities:

| Priority | Provider id       |
| -------: | ----------------- |
|      100 | `native`          |
|       80 | `claude`          |
|       70 | `agents`, `codex` |
|       60 | `gemini`          |
|       55 | `opencode`        |
|       30 | `github`          |
|       10 | `agents-md`       |

Discovered files are then deduplicated by scope:

- **One user context file** is kept across all providers. Because `native` has the highest priority, `~/.aura/agent/AGENTS.md` shadows every other user-level context file.
- **One project context file per directory depth.** Depth is measured from the current directory: the cwd is depth 0, its parent depth 1, and so on. Config subdirectories of an ancestor (`.claude/`, `.github/`, `.gemini/`, …) count as the same depth as that ancestor.
- **At the same depth, the higher-priority provider shadows the rest.**
- **Across depths, multiple files survive.** In a monorepo, an ancestor `AGENTS.md` and a package-level one are different depths and both load.
- **Byte-identical files are collapsed after ordering.** Among project copies, the one closest to the cwd survives. The single surviving user-scope file sorts after project files, so it survives instead when its content is identical to project content.

Final injection order is **farther project ancestors first**, then project files closer to the cwd, then the surviving user-scope file. Later files sit nearer the end of the generated context and are more prominent.

### Worked shadowing example

```text
repo/
  AGENTS.md
  packages/api/
    AGENTS.md
    .github/copilot-instructions.md
```

Starting in `repo/packages/api`:

- `repo/AGENTS.md` is found by `agents-md` at depth 2 and kept.
- `repo/packages/api/AGENTS.md` (`agents-md`, priority 10) and `repo/packages/api/.github/copilot-instructions.md` (`github`, priority 30) both resolve to depth 0. GitHub's higher priority shadows the package-level standalone `AGENTS.md`, so the Copilot file wins at that depth.
- The two kept files are ordered root-first, package-last, so `packages/api`'s file is the more prominent one.
- If you add `repo/packages/api/.aura/AGENTS.md`, `native` (priority 100) wins depth 0 outright, shadowing both lower-priority files.

## Injection behavior

With the default prompt template, discovered context files are injected into the opening project prompt as one `<repo-rules>` block, with one `<file>` element per surviving file in the sort order above:

```xml
<repo-rules>
You MUST follow the context files below for all tasks:
<file path="/abs/path/to/repo/AGENTS.md">
...root content...
</file>
<file path="/abs/path/to/repo/packages/api/.github/copilot-instructions.md">
...package content...
</file>
</repo-rules>
```

When `SYSTEM.md` selects the bundled custom-prompt template, the same files are emitted in that template's `<project>` / `<instructions>` section instead. In either mode, the agent sees each file's absolute path and fully expanded Markdown content (with `@` imports already resolved).

Loading is automatic — there is no need to instruct the agent to search for `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md`, `.cursorrules`, or similar files during a session.

Deeper-directory `AGENTS.md` files that were _not_ auto-loaded (for example, ones below the current directory) are surfaced separately in a `<dir-context>` block that lists their paths and tells the agent to read them before editing those directories. Those files are pointers, not full injected content.

## `@` imports

Inside any context file, an `@path` token expands inline to the referenced file's content before injection:

```markdown
# Project notes

Read @docs/architecture.md before changing storage code.
Shared release steps live in @../RELEASE.md and personal aliases in @~/.notes/aliases.md.
```

The exact rules:

- **Relative paths resolve from the importing file's own directory**, not the session's working directory.
- **`~/` and `~`** resolve from the user's home directory; absolute paths are used as-is.
- **Tokens inside fenced code blocks and inline code spans are left untouched** — useful when you want to _write about_ an `@token` without expanding it.
- **`git@github.com:org/repo.git` and `user@example.com`-style tokens are not treated as imports.** A token only counts when the `@` sits at the start of a line or after a space or tab.
- **Trailing sentence punctuation is trimmed** off the path (`. , ; : ! ? ) ] } " '`), so `@docs/setup.md.` imports `docs/setup.md`.
- **Imports recurse up to five hops.** An imported file may itself contain `@` imports, up to a total depth of five.
- **Cycles are skipped.** A file already pulled into the current expansion tree is not re-expanded, so mutual imports terminate cleanly.
- **A missing or unreadable target leaves the original `@token` text in place** rather than erroring.

## Sticky rules vs normal context

Use a normal context file (`AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, …) for the bulk of your guidance: repository overview, code style, build and test commands, review expectations, and local conventions. These load into the opening generated project context.

Use a top-level **`RULES.md`** for the handful of hard requirements that must stay active even after a long conversation has pushed the opening context far up the transcript:

```markdown
# ~/.aura/agent/RULES.md

Never commit or push unless the user explicitly asks.
Do not edit generated files.
```

`RULES.md` is special:

- It is read **only** at native locations: the active user agent directory and the nearest non-empty project `.aura/` directory selected by the cwd-to-repository-root walk. If that project directory has no `RULES.md`, discovery does not fall back to a farther `.aura/RULES.md`.
- It is loaded as an **always-apply rule**, not as a context file, so it is re-attached near the current turn and keeps its hold across long sessions.
- It is **always sticky**: frontmatter cannot make it non-sticky. If you want conditional or opt-in behavior, write a normal rule file instead (see [Skills](./skills.md)).
- Both top-level candidates are synthesized with the rule name `RULES`, and rule deduplication is name-based. In the usual case, a user `RULES.md` shadows the project `RULES.md`; they are not concatenated. Avoid naming a regular file under `.aura/rules/` or the user `rules/` directory `RULES.md`, because native regular rules load earlier and can shadow both sticky candidates.

Keep `RULES.md` short. Long background belongs in `AGENTS.md`, where it costs context budget only once.

## Disabling discovery providers

Turn a provider off with the `disabledProviders` setting in `~/.aura/agent/config.yml`, a project's `.aura/config.yml`, or a `--config` overlay:

```yaml
# .aura/config.yml
disabledProviders:
  - claude
  - github
```

`disabledProviders` is a **whole-provider switch with one shared id namespace**, used by two unrelated subsystems:

| Id kind                | Examples                                                                           | Effect when listed                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Discovery provider ids | `native`, `claude`, `codex`, `gemini`, `opencode`, `github`, `agents`, `agents-md` | The entire config source is removed — not just its context files, but also any MCP servers, slash commands, skills, hooks, tools, prompts, and settings it would have contributed. |
| Model provider ids     | `anthropic`, `openai`, `google`, `groq`, `ollama`, `openrouter`                    | The model backend is removed from selection even when its credentials are present. See [Providers](./providers.md).                                                                |

Ids are exact and the two namespaces do not collide by accident: `google` disables the Google model backend, while `gemini` disables the Gemini CLI discovery files. Disabling a discovery provider is heavier than it looks — disabling `claude`, for instance, also drops Claude-discovered MCP servers, commands, skills, hooks, tools, and settings, not only `CLAUDE.md`.

Only `enabledModels` and `disabledProviders` support **path-scoped** entries, so you can vary provider availability per subtree:

```yaml
disabledProviders:
  - github # disabled everywhere
  - path: ~/work/legacy-claude
    providers:
      - claude # disabled only under this directory
```

A scoped entry applies when the cwd equals the configured path or sits beneath it; `~` expands to home. Bare string entries apply everywhere.

Remember that higher-precedence settings layers **replace** array settings rather than appending to them. If your global config disables `claude` but a project config sets `disabledProviders: [github]`, then inside that project Claude discovery is re-enabled and only GitHub is disabled. See [Settings](./settings.md) for the full layer precedence, merge rules, and path-scoped array details.

## Troubleshooting

### A file is not loaded

- Native project context is read only from the nearest non-empty `.aura/` directory. That directory must contain a non-empty `AGENTS.md`; if it does not, discovery does not continue to a farther native directory.
- A standalone `AGENTS.md` is handled by `agents-md`, not `native`.
- `.claude/CLAUDE.md`, `.gemini/GEMINI.md`, and `.github/copilot-instructions.md` are read only from the current working directory's config directory — not from every ancestor.
- `~/.codex/AGENTS.md` and `~/.config/opencode/AGENTS.md` are user-level only and have no project equivalent.
- Empty files contribute nothing for the native and standalone providers.
- A disabled discovery provider contributes nothing — check `disabledProviders` across your global, project, and `--config` layers.

### The wrong file wins

At one user scope or project depth, the higher-priority provider shadows the others (native > claude > agents/codex > gemini > opencode > github > agents-md). To force deterministic behavior, move your guidance into `.aura/AGENTS.md` (native always wins) or disable the competing discovery provider.

### User context disappeared

Only one user-level context file survives, and `~/.aura/agent/AGENTS.md` has the highest priority. If it exists, it shadows user-level `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`, `~/.codex/AGENTS.md`, `~/.gemini/GEMINI.md`, `~/.config/opencode/AGENTS.md`, `~/.copilot/copilot-instructions.md`, and `~/.agent`/`~/.agents` files. Consolidate user guidance into the native file or remove the native one if you prefer another tool's file.

### A `RULES.md` file is ignored

Only native `RULES.md` locations are sticky: the active user agent directory and the nearest non-empty project `.aura/` directory selected from cwd toward the repo root. If a nearer non-empty `.aura/` directory exists, it blocks farther native directories even when it has no `RULES.md`. A `RULES.md` anywhere else is not a recognized convention.

### An `@` import did not expand

Confirm the target exists relative to the importing file (not the cwd). Imports inside fenced code blocks or inline code spans are intentionally left literal, `git@`/email-looking tokens are never imported, cycles are skipped, expansion stops after five hops, and a missing target leaves the original `@path` text unchanged.
